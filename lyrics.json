        Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you?
So when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

My baby here on Earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine
Nothing in the world is mine for free
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

        Between people
Between the wind
Each person has their own desires
Painted together

Ooh, when it becomes firm enough to stand on
Ah-oh, then it becomes my world
Ah-oh (Ah-oh)

My small heart
And the good things in it
Break and harden
Melt and fall away
And only then can I see my eternity

Love between people
Everyone gathers together, oh-oh-oh-oh
(Ah-oh) Hoping for eternity
If we bury our bodies and hearts, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Then our world becomes perfect, oh-oh
With love
With love

My small heart
Like small waves inside
Break and push towards you
Melting and falling away
And only then can I see my eternity

        I have never known peace
Like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger
Like these insects that feast on me
A thousand teeth
And yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased
Our heartbeats becoming slow

We lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw

And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

I have never known sleep
Like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known colour
Like this morning reveals to me
And you haven't moved an inch
Such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this
The flesh calmly going cold

We lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep

They'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

They'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long we'd become the flowers)
They'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle show fear (So long we'd become the flowers)

And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste

After the raven has had his say
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

        I'd swim across Lake Michigan
I'd sell my shoes
I'd give my body to be back again
In the rest of the room

To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you

You gave your body to the lonely
They took your clothes
You gave up a wife and a family
You gave your ghost

To be alone with me
To be alone with me
To be alone with me
You went up on a tree

To be alone with me
You went up on a tree

I've never known a man who loved me

        All the fear and the fire of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here too

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns that all words in the fight fell to

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby

And that day that we'll watch the death of the sun
That the cloud and the cold and those jeans you'll have on
And you'll gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's wasteland, baby

When the stench of the sea and the absence of green
Are the death of all things that are seen and unseen
Are the end, but the start of all things that are left to do

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

That's it

You are the wonder in my eyes

I do the move that makes you smile
I just want to take your hand
And show you

And we're not gonna waste it

I could always see a house by the ocean
Last night I could hear the waves
As I heard you say, 'All that I want is to be yours'

Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
With you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

Back when you were far away
We would go on dates to watch the same movie
And you were imagining sitting next to me
Holding my hand for the whole thing

Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
With you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
With you, baby

'Cause your white curtains, they are paper-thin
Windows open, I can feel the breeze
But we're safe here, under the sheets

I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep and listen to you breathe
Ooh, oh
I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep, I'll watch you sleep

I never get bored of looking at you
'Cause every time, I see something new
Like the scar on your spine
You fell off a roof when you were nine
You lived a life before me

I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep and listen to you breathe
Ooh, oh
I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep, I'll watch you sleep

I don't ever wanna leave
